# Solidity_1
For our first HW assignment for Solidity we had to create a Testnet to launch smart contracts for a firm that we set-up.  For my Testnet I uilized the Kovan Test Network.  If you would like to track the smart contracts that were created for our firm, the address for the contract was 0x722e8728D4eC8727Cad86bdA19241E3A1Dc85263. 
The contract creation was broken into 3 portions: 
1. Profit Splitter - which takes the ether and allocates it amongst the 3 employees
2. Tiering - the ether is allocated based on the position with the firm
3. Deferred Equity Plan - which is similar to many start-up firms, where equity stakes are disbursed after certain time windows or once certain goals are met.
